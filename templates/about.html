<hr>
hi my friend 
I thought in the morning today. What can I write about? I think I want to write about a book. Its name End Game. actually I want to talk about a character from the book. The character is Christopher. I have to say End Game was series of the 3 books. and Christopher only there is first book. His story in the book was so impressive of course according to me. Because His love was too warm. Christopher had everything. He was rich, He had too many, He was too handsome. But he didn't care all of them. He just cared Sarah. Actually Ä± cant lie 
Sarah loved Christopher to. But not as much as Christopher. I said like this because She could love other guy. I should say that. Book was too complicated so while i'll try to explain christopher, I'll lost and pass some points. now i continue to talk about. Sarah left to christopher for she had a too important mission about all of world, all of your country,family.... and she could explain to christopher because the mission must be secret. And She went a journey. But She didn't know one thing. it's about Christopher. Because He couldn't  stay without her.  he didn't stay and went to journey behind the Sarah. He followed to to her hiddenly. after then at end of journey Christopher was capture by enemy of Sarah. this guy (enemy of sarah) blackmailed to sarah with using Christopher. this guy put a gun on his head after then threatened to Sarah. After then sarah pointed her gun at this guy. But She had a problem. because He was behind to Christopher. then Sarah shooted to Christopher's head. and she killed both of them. I remember one think at the moment. Christopher said ' You can shoot me sarah it's not problem. I love you '. while He was dying he wasn't any regret. He was happy because He could say 'I love you Sarah'. He could see to Sarah again once. The last thing  He saw eyes of Sarah. This was the most precious thing at the world
